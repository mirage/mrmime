val rng : int array rng
(** A default random generator. *)

val part : ?encoding:bool -> ?header:Header.t -> buffer stream -> part
(** [part ?encoding ?header stream] makes a new part from a body stream
    [stream], with the given [header] (default to {!Header.empty}). If [header]
    contains a [Content-Transfer-Encoding] and [encoding = true] (default), the
    stream will be {b encoded} to the given encoding. Otherwise, the stream is
    not transencoded.

    The underlying behavior of the encoding depends on what the user choose:
    - For a [base64] encoding, the stream is encoded as is and the resulted
      stream emits the body line-per-line;
    - For a [raw] encoding, the stream is added as is and should respect the
      line-per-line emission;
    - For a [quoted-printable], a chunk of the given stream is considered as a
      line regardless the newline convention of the operating system (and the
      encoder put a line-break according to the RFC 2045).

    Despite the [base64] encoding which can safely be used independantly of the
    behavior of the given stream, [7bit]/[8bit] and [quoted-printable] expect a
    specific stream line-per-line. [7bit]/[8bit] should include the [CRLF]
    newline per emission and the [quoted-printable] considers a emitted chunk as
    a line (without the newline character). *)

(** [multipart ~rng ~content ~boundary ~fields parts] makes a new multipart from
    a bunch of parts, specified [Content-*] fields, others [fields] and a
    specified [boundary]. If [boundary] is not specifed, we use [rng] to make a
    random boundary (we did not check that it does not appear inside [parts]).
