       Where a two or three digit year occurs in a date, the year is to be
       interpreted as follows: If a two digit year is encountered whose
       value is between 00 and 49, the year is interpreted by adding 2000,
       ending up with a value between 2000 and 2049.  If a two digit year is
       encountered with a value between 50 and 99, or any three digit year
       is encountered, the year is interpreted by adding 1900.

       Differences from Earlier Specifications
       3.   Four or more digits allowed for year.
       15.  Two digit years not allowed.*
       16.  Three digit years interpreted, but not allowed for generation.*

       Time zone may be indicated in several ways.  "UT" is Univer-
       sal  Time  (formerly called "Greenwich Mean Time"); "GMT" is per-
       mitted as a reference to Universal Time.  The  military  standard
       uses  a  single  character for each zone.  "Z" is Universal Time.
       "A" indicates one hour earlier, and "M" indicates 12  hours  ear-
       lier;  "N"  is  one  hour  later, and "Y" is 12 hours later.  The
       letter "J" is not used.  The other remaining two forms are  taken
       from ANSI standard X3.51-1975.  One allows explicit indication of
       the amount of offset from UT; the other uses  common  3-character
       strings for indicating time zones in North America.

     From RFC 2822

       obs-zone        =       "UT" / "GMT" /          ; Universal Time

       In the obsolete time zone, "UT" and "GMT" are indications of
       "Universal Time" and "Greenwich Mean Time" respectively and are both
       semantically identical to "+0000".

       The remaining three character zones are the US time zones.  The first
       letter, "E", "C", "M", or "P" stands for "Eastern", "Central",
       "Mountain" and "Pacific".  The second letter is either "S" for
       "Standard" time, or "D" for "Daylight" (or summer) time.  Their
       interpretations are as follows:

       EDT is semantically equivalent to -0400
       EST is semantically equivalent to -0500
       CDT is semantically equivalent to -0500
       CST is semantically equivalent to -0600

       MST is semantically equivalent to -0700
       PDT is semantically equivalent to -0700
       PST is semantically equivalent to -0800

       The 1 character military time zones were defined in a non-standard
       way in [RFC822] and are therefore unpredictable in their meaning.
       The original definitions of the military zones "A" through "I" are
       equivalent to "+0100" through "+0900" respectively; "K", "L", and "M"
       are equivalent to  "+1000", "+1100", and "+1200" respectively; "N"
       through "Y" are equivalent to "-0100" through "-1200" respectively;
       and "Z" is equivalent to "+0000".  However, because of the error in
       [RFC822], they SHOULD all be considered equivalent to "-0000" unless
       there is out-of-band information confirming their meaning.

       Other multi-character (usually between 3 and 5) alphabetic time zones
       have been used in Internet messages.  Any such time zone whose
       meaning is not known SHOULD be considered equivalent to "-0000"
       unless there is out-of-band information confirming their meaning.
